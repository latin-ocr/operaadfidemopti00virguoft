“ From the time that a boy at school commences translation of the simplest
:i-nd‚ derivations should be attended to ; and we consider ΜΓ. Riddle's a in plest
able book, when compared with other Dictionaries, merely on the ground os its
Aroe stock of derivations. In the monotony of early instruction these are,
aefflaps, the very first things that awaken curiosity and interest; a momentar
=scape and respite, if only apparent, from the matter in hand, is that sor whic
aoy-s are continually cras-ing3 and this may be more advantageously indu , ed by
Jrequent reference to kindred English words, in which they feel themse ves at
